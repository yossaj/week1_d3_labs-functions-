stops = [ "Croy", "Cumbernauld", "Falkirk High", "Linlithgow", "Livingston", "Haymarket" ]

# 1. Add `"Edinburgh Waverley"` to the end of the array
# 2. Add `"Glasgow Queen St"` to the start of the array

# 4. Work out the index position of `"Linlithgow"`
# 5. Remove `"Livingston"` from the array using its name
# 6. Delete `"Cumbernauld"` from the array by index
# 7. How many stops there are in the array?
# 8. How many ways can we return `"Falkirk High"` from the array?
# 9. Reverse the positions of the stops in the array
# 10. Print out all the stops using a for loop
